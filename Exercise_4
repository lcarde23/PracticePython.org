#Exercise 4 have the user input a number and print our the divisors of that number

question = int(input("Please enter a number. "))
x = range(2,100) # listrange = list(range(1, num+1)) this way the list is only 1 number larger than the number inputted
divisorList = []

for i in x:
    if question % i ==0:
        divisorList.append(i)

print(divisorList)
